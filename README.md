[Link to pptx](pts-AMLS.pptx)  

## Demos

To run the demos and code you need to setup an environment with python and AMLS SDK.  Frankly, the easiest way to do this is by deploying a Data Science Virtual Machine.  [Deployment ARM Template](ARMTemplates-Deployment/DSVM/README.md).  

Otherwise, to use your local environment, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python) which should cover everything needed.  


To use a free Azure Notebooks environment, follow [these instructions](https://notebooks.azure.com/davew/projects/azureml-getting-started).  

### Intelligent Kiosk Examples

[Quite simple instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk/) and you can run the "Intelligent Driver demo" on your laptop.
